# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

This Python script generates a Chuck Norris joke and personalizes it with a random name from a list. The joke is then sent to a Microsoft Teams channel via a webhook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pymsteams
- requests

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pymsteams requests
```

Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. **Get a Microsoft Teams Webhook URL**:
   - To create a MS Teams webhook, check the tutorial at https://medium.com/@jacopocastellano/chuck-norris-comes-to-ms-teams-a-joke-generator-script-a98e03146818 
   - Or follow the official documentation at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet

2. **Configure the script**:
   - Open `start_chuck.py`
   - Replace `Insert_Here_Your_MS_Teams_Webhook_URL` on line 25 with your actual Microsoft Teams webhook URL

## Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python start_chuck.py
```

The script will:
1. Fetch a random Chuck Norris joke from the API
2. Replace "Chuck Norris" with a random name from the predefined list
3. Send the personalized joke to your Microsoft Teams channel

## Customization

- **Names**: You can modify the `list_of_names` on line 14 to add or remove names for personalization
- **Scheduling**: Set up the script to run automatically using crontab (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows)

### Example crontab entry (runs daily at 9 AM):
```bash
0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/start_chuck.py
```

## How It Works

1. **API Call**: Fetches a random joke from https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random
2. **Name Selection**: Chooses a random name from the predefined list
3. **Personalization**: Creates a "Norrized" version by replacing the last name with "Norris"
4. **Text Replacement**: Substitutes "Chuck Norris" in the joke with the personalized name
5. **Teams Integration**: Sends the joke to Microsoft Teams via webhook

## Troubleshooting

- **Module not found errors**: Make sure you've installed the requirements with `pip install pymsteams requests`
- **Webhook errors**: Verify your Teams webhook URL is correct and the channel is accessible
- **API errors**: The Chuck Norris API is free and doesn't require authentication, but check your internet connection
